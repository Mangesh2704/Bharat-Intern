# Iris Flowers Classification using Machine Learning

This project is an interactive Python application built using PyQt5 and scikit-learn for the classification of Iris flowers into different species (setosa, versicolor, virginica) based on their sepal and petal lengths. It uses a Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier to make predictions.

## Features

- User-friendly GUI for entering sepal length and petal length.
- Real-time prediction of the Iris flower species.
- Stylish design with customizable fonts and button styles.
- Easily adaptable for other machine learning classifiers and datasets.

## Getting Started

To get started with this project, make sure you have Python and the required libraries (scikit-learn, PyQt5, pandas, numpy) installed. You can run the application by executing the provided Python script.

```bash
python iris_classification.py
```

## Usage

1. Launch the application.
2. Enter the sepal length and petal length of an Iris flower.
3. Click the "Predict" button to see the predicted species.
